Determining Student Trajectories Through Personal, Familial, and
Economic Dimensions.



Introduction: When considering the costs of college and the difficulty of passing the higherlevel courses one must take to graduate, we should be interested in seeing whether or not we can
predict success of students. When looking into this data, I wanted to see what factors
contribute the most significantly to if a student was able to graduate.

Methods: The study focused on all students within higher education institutes, encompassing
diverse socio-economic backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The sample was
drawn from a specific institution offering undergraduate degrees in fields like agronomy, design,
education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technology. Data collection
involved accessing the student database of this institution, yielding an initial dataset of 35
variables. Out of which, 10 predictor variables and 2 response variables were selected which
seemed as the most significant predictors for the study's outcomes. A Structural Equation Model
(SEM) was employed to analyze and visualize the relationships among these variables.

Results: The path diagram (Fig 1.) shows which dimensions and factors have the greatest impact
on Enrollment, those being Cost, Educational Special Needs, and Student Qualifications.
However, only Cost and Age of Enrollment are statistically significant, meaning the impact of
those dimensions can be abstracted out to a larger sample size. The correlation plot (Fig 2.)
shows the correlation between our two response variables and our loading matrix (Fig 3.) shows
that only Age of Enrollment was a complex loading.

Discussion: The analysis of this data helped us understand the impact several factors have on
enrollment of students. Multiple factors, Educational Special Needs and Student Qualification,
had large impacts on enrollment with values of -0.818 and 0.127 respectively, however only Cost
and Age of Enrollment had p values below 0.05 making them the only statistically significant
dimensions/factors. The results show that, unsurprisingly, cost is far and away the most
impactful variable when determining whether a student will remain enrolled or not. It had an
impact of 21.201 which is more than 20 times the impact of any other dimension, meaning in the
broader context of things, GDP and whether Tuition is up to date are things to watch when trying
to increase graduation rates.
