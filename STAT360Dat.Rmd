#The response variables are Target and SecondSemCredit. These two variables represent whether a student is a graduate, currently enrolled, or a dropout, and then what their grades were at the end of the second semester. These two seem relatively correlated as students with higher grades probably graduate, and visa versa with drop outs.

# removed a number of variables from the original kaggle dataset, to narrow down to 10 predictor variables, but no variables were removed for missing or invalid data. We the adjusted the qualification variables.

#The student, mother, and father qualifications predictors all needed to be reformatted as there were dozens of categories, so they were normalized to:


# 0 -> Did not attend Middle School
# 
# 1 -> Taken Middle School Classes
# 
# 2 -> Taken High School Classes
# 
# 3 -> HS Grad
# 
# 4 -> Taken College Classes
# 
# 5 -> Undergrad degree
# 
# 6 -> Master's
# 
# 7 -> PhD


# for the mother and father columns, and:


# 0 -> Taken MS Classes
# 
# 1 -> Taken HS Classes
# 
# 2 -> HS Degree
# 
# 3 -> Taken College Classes
# 
# 4 -> UG Degree
# 
# 5 -> Masters
# 
# 6 -> PhD


# for the previous qualifications. 

#Every other predictor and response variable has a low and a high, although the scale is unknown for some, and Target was changed so Dropout is -1, Enrolled is 0, and Graduate is 1.

#Prominent factor indicators: only have 2 factors, each with only 2 dimensions loading onto them. However, the two non-scaled dimensions both have p values less than 0.05 meaning they are statistically significant. GDP has an estimated impact of -0.62 on Economy with a p value of 0.023, and Scholarship has an impact of 1.073 on Cost with a p value of 0. This means that for every unit increase in GDP, Economy will decrease by 0.62 and if a student has a scholarship, Cost has a 1.073 unit increase.

#Significant predictors of Enrollment: The significant prediictors of Enrollment, the response variables, are Enrollment Age, Cost, and Economy. Enrollment age has an impact of -0.017 with a p value of 0, Cost has an impact of 10.531 and a p value of 0, and Economy has an impact of -0.09 and a p value of 0.047. All of the predictors have an impact on the response variables in this sample, however these three predictors are the only ones we can abstract their impact to a larger population. This makes sense as students come from such a diverse background, however predictors that have to do with money, such as cost and economy, have a significant impact as college is a very expensive thing. The interesting predictor was enrollment age as I hadn't thought about it, but if someone enrolls later on in life, maybe they have a higher chance of dropping out.

#The model appears to be mediocre as mfi = 0.919 which is good, but other indicators like cfi = 0.739, ifi = 0.741, and rmsea = 0.069 are all outside of their desired ranges. This indicates that while the model might be a decent fit, there is potentially a better model to fit the data where more indicies indicate a good fit.
